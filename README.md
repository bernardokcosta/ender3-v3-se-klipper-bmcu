# Klipper for Ender 3 V3 SE with BMCU

[![Ender 3 V3 SE CI](https://github.com/bernardokcosta/ender3-v3-se-klipper-bmcu/actions/workflows/ender3-v3-se.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bernardokcosta/ender3-v3-se-klipper-bmcu/actions/workflows/ender3-v3-se.yml)
[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/bernardokcosta/ender3-v3-se-klipper-bmcu?include_prereleases)](https://github.com/bernardokcosta/ender3-v3-se-klipper-bmcu/releases)
[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-blue.svg)](COPYING)

This is an unofficial [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/) fork for a
physically verified Creality Ender 3 V3 SE with:

- Mainboard `CR4NS200320C14`
- `GD32F303RET6` microcontroller
- Stock TJC3224/DWIN 3.2 inch display
- USB serial host connection and stock display cabling

The implementation is based on current upstream Klipper and keeps the machine
support isolated in a small MCU bridge, a Klippy extra, modular configuration,
tests, and documentation. It does not include the historical PRTouch/HX711
auto-Z implementation; probing uses Klipper's upstream CR-Touch support.

## Version 0.2.0 pre-release

- BMCU-Klipper **1.0.6**, with BMCU firmware **1.0.1**, using
  `generic_single_extruder`: four channels feed one physical extruder.
- Complete, calibratable load/purge and cutter-free tip-forming/unload sequences.
- Shared display/macro heating sequence, cancellation, duplicate-click guards,
  G-code state restoration, and pause/resume/cancel integration.
- Stock display menus in **English (default)** and **Brazilian Portuguese**,
  with current/target temperature, printer state and confirmed active channel.
- 50 automated display and filament regression tests, including real Klipper
  macro parsing and G-code state handling.

This is a pre-release requiring physical commissioning. Filament load/unload
starts **disabled** until distances and BMCU arrival are calibrated. Screen
accents and tip formation have not been verified on the physical assembly.
See the [0.2.0 release notes](docs/releases/v0.2.0.md).

## Safety and hardware scope

This firmware is an early public release and has not completed physical
acceptance testing on every board or display revision. A `C14` board marking
does not identify the MCU by itself. Open the electronics enclosure and verify
the actual chip before flashing.

Do not use this build on an STM32F401 board. Before printing, verify heater
outputs and their matching thermistors, endstops, motor directions, travel
limits, CR-Touch, Z offset, and emergency power-off behavior. The software and
its contributors provide no warranty; see the GPLv3 warranty terms in
[`COPYING`](COPYING).

## Downloads

Download the newest CI-validated build from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bernardokcosta/ender3-v3-se-klipper-bmcu/releases).
Pre-releases appear in this list; GitHub's `/releases/latest` may omit them.
Each release provides:

- `klipper.bin`: MCU firmware for the verified GD32F303 target
- `klipper.dict`: matching MCU protocol dictionary
- `defconfig`: normalized Kconfig used for the build
- `BUILD-METADATA.txt`: source commit, upstream base, target, and build date
- `SHA256SUMS`: checksums for the downloadable build files

The Klippy host checkout and MCU firmware must come from the same release tag.
Do not combine the release binary with a different branch or commit.

To flash, place `klipper.bin` on a FAT32 microSD card and give it a short,
previously unused filename ending in `.bin`, for example `kli0917.bin`. Read the
complete [installation and commissioning guide](docs/Ender3_V3_SE.md) before
powering or moving the printer.

## Configuration

The entry configuration is:

[`config/printer-creality-ender3-v3-se-gd32f303-2023.cfg`](config/printer-creality-ender3-v3-se-gd32f303-2023.cfg)

Copy it and the modular directory to the Mainsail configuration directory:

```sh
cp config/printer-creality-ender3-v3-se-gd32f303-2023.cfg \
  ~/printer_data/config/printer.cfg
cp -r config/ender3-v3-se ~/printer_data/config/
```

Confirm the MCU path in `config/ender3-v3-se/board.cfg`. PID values, Z offset,
bed mesh, pressure advance, and input shaping are intentionally not shipped as
machine-independent values. Calibrate them on the physical printer.

Install BMCU modules/services with the
[official BMCU-Klipper installer](https://github.com/jarczakpawel/BMCU-Klipper/tree/v1.0.6).
This repository provides endpoint callbacks and configuration; it does not
install or replace BMCU's modules. Do not duplicate `[bmcu]`.

Before enabling filament transport, identify the Linux UART device and PC9
GPIO chip/line, measure switch-to-gear and complete route distances, and tune
tip formation. The integration deliberately leaves these machine-specific
values unset. A switch far from the gears stops sensor-based BMCU feeding
before the extruder can capture the tip; follow the
[BMCU setup and calibration guide](docs/Ender3_V3_SE_BMCU.md) for arrival modes.

Select the screen language in `ender3-v3-se/display.cfg`:

```ini
[e3v3se_display]
language: en
```

Use `language: pt_BR` for Brazilian Portuguese and restart Klipper. Code,
comments and documentation remain in English. Menu **Prepare > BMCU channels**
provides channels 1-4 (command indices 0-3) and full unload. When BMCU is
unavailable, navigation remains functional and channel actions are blocked.
